      para_1: "The ICCA Registry website is an online information platform for Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, where communities themselves provide data, case studies, maps, photos and stories which result in useful statistics and analysis on featured ICCAs around the world.  Participation in the ICCA Registry is a voluntary process, with %{benefits_link} for participating communities.  The ICCA Registry is inclusive of a secure, current non-publically accessible database on ICCAs and is a critical mechanism for understanding the conservation impact of communities."

    icca_title: "Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas"
    para_1: "Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs) are natural sites, resources and species' habitats conserved in a voluntary and self-directed way through	community values, practices, rules and institutions. For hundreds of years, indigenous people and local communities have been a crucial part of conservation. While the conservation practices of ICCAs are potentially the oldest on earth, they are under- recognized and not well understood, thus leaving them in jeopardy from lack of political and financial support and increasingly vulnerable to external threats. Recent international meetings, including the 2003 World Parks Congress and the 2004 Programme of Work on Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity, have contributed to a re-evaluation of ICCAs as one of the main avenues to strengthen sustainable natural resource use and conservation. Thus, there is a need for detailed knowledge and experience to be gathered, analyzed, and shared. "
    para_2: "The ICCA Registry website is a pilot online database for Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, offering information, maps, statistics and analysis on featured ICCAs to indigenous communities, researchers, conservation practitioners, policy and decision-makers and general public who want to understand and obtain information on ICCAs characteristics and geographical extent."
    para_3: "The purpose of the website is to help people understand ICCAs and their biodiversity, ecological and cultural values. The website aims to be a key source of global information and data on ICCAs for involved communities, practitioners, researchers and the general public. Through this website, information on ICCAs from different countries and regions of the world will be available in one place, guaranteeing improved access to information about ICCAs. In particular, the database will hold qualitative, quantitative and spatial data.	The degree to which this is available directly to the public depends on the agreements we have with those who have contributed the information. The website, featured with visual aids and tools such as maps, videos and photos, represents the best way to circulate this valuable data around the globe, demonstrate ICCA conservation value and foster ICCA recognition."

  about:
    about_title: "About ICCAs"
    para_1: "Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs) are defined as:"
    para_2: '<b>"natural and/or modified ecosystems containing significant biodiversity values and ecological services, voluntarily conserved by (sedentary and mobile) indigenous and local communities, through customary laws or other effective means."</b> (World Parks Congress Recommendation V26, 2003)'
    para_3: 'Examples of ICCAs include indigenous territories, indigenous protected areas, cultural land- and seascapes, sacred sites and species, migration routes of mobile indigenous peoples, bio-cultural heritage territories, sustainable resource reserves, fishing grounds, and community-managed areas. The total size of areas under this type of governance is not clear and likely severely underestimated.'
    para_4: "ICCAs protect an enormous range of natural environments, wildlife species and agricultural and pastoral landscapes managed through a wide diversity of institutions and rules by traditional and modern communities alike. These sites range from less than one hectare to entire mountains, lakes or landscapes and seascapes. Although there is no clear idea of the extent of area that ICCAs cover across the globe, it is estimated that some 11% of the world's forests are under community ownership or administration. Thus, the contribution of ICCAs to biodiversity conservation is an important consideration as a tool for protecting natural resources and human livelihoods."
    para_5: "In addition to the direct value that ICCAs may confer to the diverse species, habitats and ecological processes that benefit from their management, there are multiple environmental services, such as carbon storage and water purification, that are enabled by supporting the viability of ICCAs.	Given the significant but undocumented role of indigenous and locally managed areas in maintaining biological diversity and ecological processes, initiatives such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) and those that address adaption to climate change will rely more on current knowledge of ICCAs as their efforts become more widespread and urgent."
    para_6: "Though ICCAs are extremely diverse in a number of ways, they all contain three essential features:"

    icca_elem_1: "A strong relationship exists between one or more indigenous or local communities (sedentary or mobile) and their physical environment (such as a given ecosystem, habitat, resource or species) as a result of cultural, social, economic and other reasons."
    icca_elem_2: "The concerned indigenous peoples or local community plays a key role in making decisions about the management of the ecosystem, area or species. The community possesses (in law or in practice) the power to make and enforce key management decisions regarding the territory and resources."
    icca_elem_3: "The voluntary management decisions and efforts of the concerned community lead to, or at least are well in the process of leading to, the conservation of biodiversity, habitats, species, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless of the original management objectives as perceived by the community."

    title: "<em>ICCA Registry</em>"
    project_title: "The project"
    project_text_1: 'The Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas Registry project has been developed in response to recent global meetings and is advised by the <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.iccaforum.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86&Itemid=102">ICCA Consortium</a>, a collaborative group of experts and organizations formed during the 2008 World Conservation Congress. Through a multi-faceted process, this group is gradually working with indigenous and local communities who want to raise awareness of this type of governance and the contributions that their communities are making to conservation. UNEP-WCMC, as a partner in the ICCA Consortium, is playing a key role in building awareness and recognition of ICCAs through developing an interactive registry for ICCAs worldwide.'
    project_text_2: 'The collection of information will be a collaborative process, ensuring slow but positive support of the concept, and engaging staff at UNEP-WCMC as well as members of the Consortium and consultants in the field. Members of indigenous and local communities will be essential and central contributors to this knowledge base.'
    project_text_3: 'The Registry, developed in the same structure as the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA, see <a class="textLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.wdpa.org">www.wdpa.org</a> for more information), will store two types of information that are critical to understanding ICCAs: (1) descriptive information, such as the main habitats within the ICCA and the names of the community or communities living within or near the ICCA, and (2) spatial information, such as the size, location and boundaries of the area.	The Registry will be linked in part to the WDPA for enhanced access to information about protected areas.'
