      para_1: "The ICCA Registry website is an online information platform for Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, where communities themselves provide data, case studies, maps, photos and stories which result in useful statistics and analysis on featured ICCAs around the world.  Participation in the ICCA Registry is a voluntary process, with %{benefits_link} for participating communities.  The ICCA Registry is inclusive of a secure, current non-publically accessible database on ICCAs and is a critical mechanism for understanding the conservation impact of communities."
      benefits_link: "multiple benefits"
      para_2: "The website and related products are designed for an audience which includes indigenous peoples, local communities, conservation practitioners, policy and decision-makers, researchers, and the general public, who want to understand and build their knowledge on ICCAs, their diverse biological, ecological and cultural values, and their geographical extent. Case studies provide an introduction to the broad range and diversity of ICCAs which exist. The Registry complements other efforts to understand the impacts of community conservation through documentation and sharing of experiences and analyses."
      para_3: "The overall goal of the ICCA Registry is to provide the best available knowledge held on ICCAs. Information on ICCAs from different countries and regions of the world will be available in one place. In particular, the database holds qualitative, quantitative and spatial data. The degree to which this data is available to the public depends on the agreements we have with the communities who have contributed the information. The website, which features visual media such as maps, videos and photos, represents a positive mechanism to circulate this valuable data around the globe, demonstrate the conservation value of ICCAs, and foster greater recognition of ICCAs."

    icca_title: "Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas"
    para_1: "Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs) are natural sites, resources and species' habitats conserved in a voluntary and self-directed way through	community values, practices, rules and institutions. For hundreds of years, indigenous people and local communities have been a crucial part of conservation. While the conservation practices of ICCAs are potentially the oldest on earth, they are under- recognized and not well understood, thus leaving them in jeopardy from lack of political and financial support and increasingly vulnerable to external threats. Recent international meetings, including the 2003 World Parks Congress and the 2004 Programme of Work on Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity, have contributed to a re-evaluation of ICCAs as one of the main avenues to strengthen sustainable natural resource use and conservation. Thus, there is a need for detailed knowledge and experience to be gathered, analyzed, and shared. "
    para_2: "The ICCA Registry website is a pilot online database for Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, offering information, maps, statistics and analysis on featured ICCAs to indigenous communities, researchers, conservation practitioners, policy and decision-makers and general public who want to understand and obtain information on ICCAs characteristics and geographical extent."
    para_3: "The purpose of the website is to help people understand ICCAs and their biodiversity, ecological and cultural values. The website aims to be a key source of global information and data on ICCAs for involved communities, practitioners, researchers and the general public. Through this website, information on ICCAs from different countries and regions of the world will be available in one place, guaranteeing improved access to information about ICCAs. In particular, the database will hold qualitative, quantitative and spatial data.	The degree to which this is available directly to the public depends on the agreements we have with those who have contributed the information. The website, featured with visual aids and tools such as maps, videos and photos, represents the best way to circulate this valuable data around the globe, demonstrate ICCA conservation value and foster ICCA recognition."

    about_title: "About ICCAs"
    para_1: "Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs) are defined as:"
    para_2: "<b>\"natural and/or modified ecosystems containing significant biodiversity values and ecological services, voluntarily conserved by (sedentary and mobile) indigenous and local communities, through customary laws or other effective means.\"</b> (%{citation_link})"
    para_3: "Examples of ICCAs include indigenous territories, indigenous protected areas, cultural land- and seascapes, sacred sites and species, migration routes of mobile indigenous peoples, bio-cultural heritage territories, sustainable resource reserves, fishing grounds, and community-managed areas. Although there is no clear idea of the extent of area that ICCAs cover across the globe, it is estimated that some 11% of the world's forests are under community ownership or administration1. Recent international meetings, including the 2003 World Parks Congress and the 2004 Programme of Work on Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity, have contributed to a re-evaluation of ICCAs as one of the main avenues to strengthen sustainable natural resource use and conservation. While the conservation practices of ICCAs are potentially the oldest on earth, they are under- recognized and not well understood, thus leaving them in jeopardy from lack of political and financial support and increasingly vulnerable to external threats."

    benefits_title: "Benefits of ICCAs"
    para_4: "While the exact spatial extent and global numbers of ICCAs are still unknown, it is clear that ICCAs protect an enormous range of natural environments, wildlife species and agricultural and pastoral landscapes managed through a wide diversity of institutions and rules by traditional and modern communities alike. These sites range from less than one hectare to entire mountains, lakes or landscapes and seascapes. Thus, the contribution of ICCAs to biodiversity conservation is an important consideration as a tool for protecting natural resources and human livelihoods."
    para_5: "In addition to the direct value that ICCAs confer to the diverse species, habitats and ecological processes benefitting from their management, there are multiple environmental services, such as carbon storage and water purification, that are enabled by supporting the viability of ICCAs. Given the significant but undocumented role of indigenous and locally managed areas in maintaining biological diversity and ecological processes, initiatives such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) and those that address adaption to climate change will rely more heavily on current knowledge of ICCAs as their efforts become more widespread and urgent."

    characteristics_title: "Defining Characteristics of ICCAs"
    characteristics_text: "Though ICCAs are extremely diverse in a number of ways, they all contain three essential features:"

    icca_elem_1: "A strong relationship exists between indigenous or local communities (sedentary or mobile) and their physical environment (such as a given ecosystem, habitat, resource or species) as a result of cultural, social, economic and other reasons."
    icca_elem_2: "The concerned indigenous peoples or local community plays a key role in making decisions about the management of the ecosystem, area or species. The community possesses (in law or in practice) the power to make and enforce key management decisions regarding the territory and resources."
    icca_elem_3: "The voluntary management decisions and efforts of the concerned community lead to, or at least are well in the process of leading to, the conservation of biodiversity, habitats, species, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless of the original management objectives as perceived by the community."

These threats include direct and indirect impacts from human activities as well as natural phenomena.  As efforts to document ICCAs increases, we expect to understand more clearly the threats to communities. The ICCA Registry assesses the range of threats that ICCAs face as a natural step in understanding the full range of solutions available."

    para_1: "The Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas Registry was developed in response to a growing recognition that local communities and indigenous peoples play a significant role in protecting and maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. Despite this raised awareness, there has been no consistent way to measure and document the values and roles of communities in conservation; as a result, the Registry idea was generated. The aim is to build a solid base of evidence at a scale that approaches our current knowledge of the biodiversity conservation impact of government managed national parks and protected areas."
    para_2: "The development of the ICCA Registry has been guided by input at recent global meetings and is advised by the %{link}, a collaborative group of experts and organizations formed during the 2008 World Conservation Congress. Through a multi-faceted process, this group is gradually working with indigenous and local communities who want to raise awareness of community governance and the contributions that Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities are making to conservation. UNEP-WCMC, as a partner in the ICCA Consortium, is playing a key role in building awareness and recognition of ICCAs through management of an interactive registry for ICCAs worldwide."

    fpic_title: "Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC)"
    fpic_para: "The Registry adheres to the principle of Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC), whereby communities must give their consent prior to participating in a project that may affect them. The ICCA Registry has developed a special FPIC form which must be completed and signed by communities or their representative prior to the ICCA being registered. The purpose of this form is to record consent and ensure that communities are aware of the process of contributing information to the Registry, they know how and what information will be used and accessed, and they have a choice regarding what information will be disclosed through various means (such as on the ICCA website and in future analytical publications). All communities can select the extent to which their information is shared. No information submitted will be shared without consent."

    future_title: "Future of the ICCA Registry"
    future_para: "The number of communities who register their ICCAs with the Registry will likely increase as the importance of locally-managed conservation gains greater recognition at the global scale.  An advisory group is being established to ensure validation of communities who register; this will maintain credibility of the process and benefit to communities who are working so diligently to protect and manage their resources and culture. Ultimately, this wealth of information can serve as a learning platform amongst indigenous peoples and community members across the world who share common successes and challenges despite their diverse cultures and natural habitats. In the future, we anticipate the development of a searchable, partially accessible online database that can help inform policies and contribute to the recognition of communities as critical custodians for biodiversity and livelihoods."
