    <h2>Instructions for contributing to the Registry</h2>
    <p>
      For communities and others who want to contribute to the Registry and benefit from using it, there are several
      important but simple steps to follow.  These are outlined below as a guide.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Discuss among community members the ICCA Registry. </h2>
    <p>
      Members of the community need to review together the benefits and risks of contributing to the Registry so that
      everyone is aware of the process, the challenges, and the potential positive and negative consequences.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Step 2:  Review the <%= link_to "Free Prior Informed Consent Form", "docs/WDPA%20ICCA%20consent%20form.doc" %>
      and <%= link_to "Project Information Sheet", "docs/WDPA%20ICCA%20info%20sheet.doc" %>, organize a meeting with
      community members to attain key signatures, and return the consent form.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this consent form is to ensure that indigenous and local communities are aware of the process of
      contributing information about their communities to the Registry, they know how and what information will be used
      and accessed, and they have a choice regarding what information will be disclosed through various means (such as
      the ICCA website and future analytical publications).  All communities can select the extent to which their
      information is shared.  This step follows the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
      Indigenous Peoples (September 2007) to protect communities and their best interests.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Step 3: Compile data for the Registryâ€™s questionnaire.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <% if current_user %>
          The ICCA Registry questionnaire can be accessed and completed
          <%= link_to "HERE", "http://surveymonkey.com" %>.
      <% else %>
          Before you can fill in the ICCA Registry questionnaire, you must first <%= link_to "register", new_user_path %>
      <% end %>
       It is also available as
      a Word Document to download, or can be requested by email.  There are around 10 core questions that each community
      should address to help inform key ICCA issues.  Answers to additional questions will enhance understanding of the
      contribution of ICCAs from around the world, including information on management and governance. If the ICCA is
      already recognised by national legislation or a protected area system, the community should work with government
      representatives where possible to provide spatial and other information.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Step 4: Submit photos, videos, and visual material.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Because the ICCA Registry website is intended to be an interactive and highly visual multi-media tool, we
      encourage all communities to send photos of community members, habitats, species, videos, interview clips and
      other material to iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org.  Photos and videos should be of good resolution, with a minimum of
      300 dpi, for inclusion on the website. They all should be clearly labelled with the specific ICCA reference.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Step 5: Submit relevant documents or website links.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It will be possible to include useful and relevant documents (such as management plans, community agreements and
      documented awards) on this website as well as links to existing websites that provide additional information about
      the ICCA and its conservation efforts and successes.  Please send relevant documents and links to
      <%= link_to "iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org", "mailto:iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org" %>.
